                    <h1>READING AND WRITING</h1>
                    <P>These two words always go hand in hand.
                        Everywhere you go,these two; reading and writing are used in our daily lives.<br>
                        If someone wants to relax after a day's work or after taking a test, these two<br>
                        are always appliable. Reading and writing are hobbies to many, talents to some and 
                        not forgetting that to some people, they are responsibilities.<br>
                        A relaxing environment is not complete when you are lacking a book and a pen accompanied 
                        with a cup of coffee or black tea.<br> For the introverts, writing is a form of telling a 
                        story without making eye contact which is honestly tiring. Reading is a form avoiding conversations
                        and for broadening the mind.<br> A special standing ovation to all the authors in the world who 
                        have inspired a lost soul back on track to stand up and be strong.<br>
                        <strong>Writers never die.</strong>
                    </P>
