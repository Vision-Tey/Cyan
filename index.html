                    <p>My name is Daphine Cyan. And I am hardworking, reliable, and fun to
                    to work with<br> I'm pretty sure I already told you that on the <a href="#Hom"></a>,
                     but I figured it was worth repeating.<br> You know. Just in case you weren't paying attention or something.<br>
                     For the past 15 years, I have been studying with an ambition of becoming a Medic and besides that,
                     Writing has been my other thing which i do along side reading.<br><br>

                    <h1>READING AND WRITING</h1>
                    <P>These two words always go hand in hand.
                        Everywhere you go,these two; reading and writing are used in our daily lives.<br>
                        If someone wants to relax after a day's work or after taking a test, these two<br>
                        are always appliable. Reading and writing are hobbies to many, talents to some and 
                        not forgetting that to some people, they are responsibilities.<br>
                        A relaxing environment is not complete when you are lacking a book and a pen accompanied 
                        with a cup of coffee or black tea.<br> For the introverts, writing is a form of telling a 
                        story without making eye contact which is honestly tiring. Reading is a form avoiding conversations
                        and for broadening the mind.<br> A special standing ovation to all the authors in the world who 
                        have inspired a lost soul back on track to stand up and be strong.<br>
                        <strong>Writers never die.</strong>
